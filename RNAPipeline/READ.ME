RNAPileline.py : Create directory and Generate scripts to call variants from Whole Exome sequencing
Put this script under a 'root' folder to run whole pipeline, for example ../path/to/RNAPileline/

./RNAPileline -h/-help Print Hele Message

Steps To Run the Pipeline:
step 0 :
./RNAPileline -step 0  
Create folders to store files needed
It will create Fastq, BAM, Script and Variant folder under 'Root' directory.

After this step, you need to copy all Fastq files under 'Fastq' folder.

step 1:
./RNAPileline -step 1  
Run the first part Data pre-processing
It will generate meta_data_meta.csv contains fastq file names.
It will generate swarm scripts to get BAM files from Fastq files.

After this step, bam file will appear under 'BAM' folder, you can copy more bam file under this 'BAM' folder to call variants in next step.

step 2:
./RNAPileline -step 2  
Run the second part Variant Discovery
It will generate scripts to calculate coverage of bam over Exome Region (bed file). 
It will generate swarm scripts to call variants from BAM files under 'BAM' folder.

After this step, vcf file will appear under 'Variant' folder.
